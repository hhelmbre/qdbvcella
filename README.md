QDBVCellA is a small Python project developed for an experimental project within
the Nance Lab at the University of Washington. The purpose of the project is to
determine Quantum Dot Assocation with BV2 Cells over time. 

This project is in its earliest development stages, and is currently being
built and sketched out before actual usable code is implemented.
